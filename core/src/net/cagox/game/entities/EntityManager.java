/**
 *  This class will be an Entity Manager.  Just exactly what that means will evolve over time.
 *  <p>
 *  I am currently following the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ool0zyg7iKg
 *  It is discussing how to get things up and going using the Ashley Entity System.
 *  As such, what I am building here will be for learning, and may or may not be completely rewritten
 *  or thrown out as things progress.
 *  <p>
 *  Part of the purpose of the EntityManager class is going to be to create entities and track things
 *  so that those with a graphic element will be drawn by the Ashley Entity System.
